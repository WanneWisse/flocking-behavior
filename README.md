# Flocking Behavior Simulation in 3D

This project is an implementation of **flocking behavior** in a group of particles, visualized in a 3D environment. The simulation mimics how particles (or agents) interact and move together in a cohesive group, following basic rules inspired by natural phenomena like bird flocks and fish schools.

To achieve the 3D visualization, I utilized **Three.js**, a popular JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

## 🚀 Features
- 3D simulation of flocking behavior with customizable parameters.
- Interactive visualization using Three.js for real-time rendering.
- Simulates the basic principles of flocking: separation, alignment, and cohesion.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering and graphics
- **HTML/CSS** for interface and visualization

## 🎥 Project Demo

Below is a video demonstration of the flocking behavior simulation in action:
